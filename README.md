# IODAI historical results → Sail Scoring

Reconstructs the **Irish Optimist Dinghy Association (IODAI)** event results,
year by year, from the published [Sailwave](https://www.sailwave.com/results/IODAI/)
HTML pages into importable `.sailscoring` files, and uses them to populate the
production IODAI workspace in [Sail Scoring](https://app.sailscoring.ie).

## Why

The payoff is the **cross-series identity and ranking** work on the Sail Scoring
horizon (`docs/design/horizon.md` in the app repo — the competitor-identity
spine, the workspace season ladder, and the per-competitor multi-year career-arc
page). Those features only come alive with *years of real history* in one
workspace: a sailor's whole Optimist arc — joining as a regatta-coached
eight-year-old, climbing through the junior and senior main-fleet years, to their
last races before ageing out. This repo builds that historical record so the
features have something rich to show.

See `docs/requirements/iodai-use-case.md` in the app repo for the IODAI domain
(three independent series per event, Junior/Senior fleets, Gold/Silver/Bronze
divisions, shared finish line) and `reference/2025-IODAI-Major-Event-SIs-v1.0.pdf`
for the sailing instructions.

## Target events per year

> **Focus (current):** the **4 regional championships** and the **National
> championship**. The Sprint Series, National Training Week / Crosbie Cup, and the
> (non-IODAI) Youth Nationals are lower priority — keep what's already built and
> validated, but don't invest further effort there unless asked. New sourcing
> should prioritise filling regional + Nationals gaps in the tracker.

IODAI runs ~7 events a season. For each past year we want:

| Event | Series produced | Priority |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **4 regional championships** — Leinsters, Ulsters, Connachts, Munsters | 3 each: Main (Senior + Junior fleets), Regatta Racing, Regatta Coached | **primary** |
| **National championship** | 3: Main, Regatta Racing, Regatta Coached | **primary** |
| **National Training Week** — Halloween Regatta (Halloween Cup + Crosbie Cup, one combined start) + regatta fleets | 1–3 | low |
| **Sprint Series** (runs from 2024) | 1: Main, Senior + Junior scored separately | low |
| **IODAI Trials** (2015–2020; team selection, superseded by the Youth Nationals) | 1: single combined fleet | low |
| **Irish Sailing Youth Nationals** (Optimist; not IODAI-run) | 1 | low |

A "series" here is **one group sharing a finish line** (the app's rule): an event
with Main + two regatta fleets is *three* independent series, not one. Main Fleet
holds Junior and Senior as separate scratch fleets scored independently;
Gold/Silver/Bronze is a prize subdivision within each.

‡ **Phase 2 (best-effort).** 2013 and earlier use an older **Sail100** that prints
final points — positions *and* DNC-type penalties — as bare numbers with no result
codes (a DNC shows as e.g. `46`, indistinguishable from 46th place). The engine's
`bare_dnc` rule treats any plain score above the fleet size as a DNC-equivalent,
which reconstructs almost every boat exactly and the **top-half ranking of each
fleet reliably** — the agreed bar for this phase (a few deep-fleet boats may be a
place out; venues aren't on the pages, so they're left blank/editable). 2014→2026
remain full-accuracy Phase 1. **2009–2011** are now built on this basis
(spot-checked: every fleet's winner reconstructs correctly; a few big/short-series
fleets are looser mid-pack — Munster 2009 Junior is the weakest). Some 2010/2011
Junior pages weren't found (those Main fleets are Senior-only). § **2012** is
almost entirely missing — barely archived. Ulster **Senior** is the one results
file surviving on the site (built; reconstructs exactly), and the **Nationals**
survive only as PDF exports of the old Sail100 results, transcribed to the
pipeline's HTML shape by `sources/2012/nationals/transcribe.py` (Senior 47/47
exact; Junior 95/96 — one deep-fleet redress average isn't bit-reconstructable).
No other 2012 region/fleet or results index could be located on iodai.com or in
the Wayback Machine.

**2020**: COVID-disrupted. The **regionals were cancelled** — IODAI's own page
states "Due to Covid-19, we have cancelled the first two regionals in May and
June," with a separate `leinsters-cancelled` notice, and the Wayback CDX listing
of iodai.com in 2020 shows no 2020 regional results pages. Only the **National
championship went ahead** (Royal Cork YC, 13–16 Aug) and is sourced — its page
isn't in the `/Results` index (`provisional-results-nationals-2020-royal-cork-yacht-club`).

Also sourced: the **Irish Sailing Youth Nationals (Optimist)** for 2022–2026 —
not IODAI-run, but IODAI republishes its Optimist results and the same sailors
appear, so it's useful for the identity work. For IODAI it carries the
team-selection purpose the pre-2021 **Trials** served (#3/#4); no Optimist
Youth Nationals page earlier than 2022 has been located.

**Trials** (`iodai-trials-<year>`): IODAI's team-selection events, 2015–2019
built as their own event type — one series, one combined scratch fleet ranking
Senior + Junior together (the pages' Senior/Junior column is informational).
Modeled separately from the Youth Nationals (different organiser, name and
slug family) but the two form **one selection lineage** for the identity and
ranking work: Trials (→2020) → no event in 2021 → Youth Nationals (2022→).
¶ **2020**: no separate trials regatta was held — the trials ranking was the
**combined Senior+Junior overall standings of the Nationals** (the
`naall20os.html` overall page, kept in `sources/2020/nationals/`). Those races
are already in the workspace as the built 2020 Nationals Main Fleet, and a
series = one finish-line group, so building a second series from the same
races would double-count every sailor's appearance in the identity timeline —
deliberately **not** built as a separate `.sailscoring` file.

\* **Sail100** (not Sailwave) was used for the 2019 Ulsters — the engine handles
both (same low-point model). † 2019 Munster Regatta published only an entry list
(no scored results), so only the Main fleet is built. Pre-2021 events were sourced
via the Wayback Machine; see SOURCES.md.

**`SOURCES.md`** records, per event, the iodai.com page and the exact Sailwave
result file each fleet was built from — the provenance trail behind every series.

**National Training Week** (`iodai-ntw-<year>-…`, 2021–2025 built): the
**Halloween Regatta** is one combined start — Main and Crosbie groups race
together, and the **Halloween Cup** and **Crosbie Cup** are prizes decided
within it. Each year's combined/Overall page scores that start contiguously
(DNC = fleet+1), so it builds and validates as **one series with one combined
fleet**; Regatta Racing / Regatta Coached are their own starts and series
where published. The per-Division (Senior/Junior) and per-group (Crosbie)
pages IODAI also publishes are *filtered views or re-scores of subsets of the
same races* — building them as series would duplicate every boat's races, so
they're deliberately skipped (same rule as the 2022 Ulsters Bronze re-score
views and the 2020 trials standings). This resolves the old "Crosbie Cup isn't
reconstructable" blocker: the carried positions on the Crosbie page *are* the
combined series' scores, so nothing is lost by not rebuilding that view. No
pre-2021 NTW results pages have been located (the iodai.com Results index
starts at 2021).

## Per-event process (once per past event)

1. **Find the event's iodai.com page first.** Each event has an official page on
   <https://iodai.com/> that links to its canonical Sailwave result pages — e.g.
   <https://iodai.com/2026-munster-championships/>,
   <https://iodai.com/2026-ulster-championships/>,
   <https://iodai.com/iodai-sprint-series-2026/>,
   <https://iodai.com/2026-irish-sailing-youth-national-championships/>. This page
   is the authoritative record of *which* Sailwave files are the official results,
   as opposed to test artifacts or superseded provisional uploads also visible on
   the Sailwave site. Start the detective work here, then follow its links to the
   Sailwave pages — one per *(fleet × view)*. You want the final, whole-series page
   for each fleet (Senior, Junior, Regatta Racing, Regatta Coached), not per-day or
   provisional views. <https://www.sailwave.com/results/IODAI/> is the fallback
   index if an event has no iodai.com page.
2. **Download** each page into `sources/<year>/<event>/` verbatim (`curl -O`).
3. **Add a config** entry per series to `events/y<year>.py` (create the file and
   wire it into `events/__init__.py` for a new year). Set `out` (the file slug —
   also the stable id key, never rename it after import), `fleet_order`,
   `sources`, `discards`, `nslots`, dates, venue, and logos. Copy a 2026 entry as
   a template.
4. **Build & validate:**
   ```
   python3 build.py validate    # re-scores each fleet, diffs against published Nett
   python3 build.py             # writes series/<out>.sailscoring
   ```
   `validate` must pass (every boat's reconstructed Nett matches the page) before
   the file is trustworthy.
5. **Import** `series/<out>.sailscoring` into the IODAI workspace
   (Series list → Import Series).

## Updating or re-importing a live series (`adopt`)

A *first* import discards the file's `seriesId` and mints a new one, but the
app's **Actions → Update from File** matches an existing series by `seriesId`
*alone*. So to push a correction or later races onto a series already in the
workspace, the file must carry that live series' id:

```
# In the app: open the series → Actions → Save to File. Then:
python3 build.py adopt path/to/live-export.sailscoring
```

`adopt` matches the export to a config by series name, records its id in
`adopted-series-ids.json`, and rebuilds so that file re-imports over the live
series. The mapping is committed, so later regenerations stay re-importable.

## How the reconstruction works

In a scratch Appendix-A fleet the displayed low-point score *is* the finishing
position, so each race cell maps back to a finish: a bare number → placing
(`sortOrder`), `"<pts> <CODE>"` → coded finish (`resultCode`), an additive
penalty like `ZFP` → a finish with `penaltyCode`. Parentheses (a discard) are
dropped — the app's engine recomputes discards. `validate` re-scores with a
low-point engine mirroring the app's `lib/scoring.ts` and confirms the
reconstructed Nett matches the published page, every boat.

A handful of boats carry published Nett values that genuinely can't be
reproduced from the source (un-averaged ties, whole-number penalties, wrong
DNC/DNF bases). These are flagged `suspect=[...]` in the config, tolerated by
`validate`, and collected in [SUSPECTS.md](SUSPECTS.md) for manual audit.

Separately, `python3 audit.py` reports **name / cross-series-identity**
data-quality issues in the built files — blank names, mojibake, single-token
names, and sail-number "loan" candidates — into [IDENTITY-AUDIT.md](IDENTITY-AUDIT.md).
These muddle a sailor's recurring identity once imported (sailscoring #218); fix
them at source here and re-import. A stopgap capture of the ad-hoc audits — the
production, DB-side, cross-class version lives with `reconcile-identities` in the app.

All ids are deterministic (UUIDv5 of a stable key), so rebuilding is byte-stable
— re-running after more races publish changes only the new race data, never ids.

## Competitor identity manifest (#218)

The same sailor recurs across years under different sail numbers, name spellings,
and clubs. `manifest.py` is the **golden record** that ties those rows together
into one cross-series competitor — version-controlled, so re-importing the corpus
and applying the manifest reproduces the same competitors (and the same public
URLs) every time, instead of clicking through the app's reconcile UI.

```
python3 bootstrap.py            # draft manifest.py from the app's matcher
python3 bootstrap.py --force    # regenerate the draft (discards hand-curation)
```

`bootstrap.py` clusters every *named* competitor through the app's **canonical
matcher** — the sibling repo's `pnpm cluster-rows`, the very matcher
`reconcile-identities` uses — and writes a draft `manifest.py`. It clusters the
archive's own rows (not the live workspace) so every cluster is keyed by
`(series-slug, sail)` directly; the app mints fresh competitor ids on import, so
the live ids can't be mapped back to a slug after the fact. **Needs the sibling
app repo at `../sailscoring`** (and `pnpm`) for the matcher.

Then **curate by hand**: merge the nickname/typo splits the matcher leaves as
review suggestions (commented at the top of the draft), split over-merged
namesakes, fix names ([IDENTITY-AUDIT.md](IDENTITY-AUDIT.md) catalogues the source
issues), assign slugs. Each `C(...)` is one competitor; its `rows` are the
`(series-slug, sail)` pairs it appears under. The slug is the stable key and the
public-URL handle — mint it once, never change it. The 149 blank-name rows are
excluded from the draft (a sail-only entry can't anchor a person); recover or
exclude them at source.

**Compile, then apply.** `manifest.py` is readable (`(series-slug, sail)` rows),
but the app needs each series' *live* seriesId — which it mints fresh on import,
so the archive can't derive it. Dump them from the running app and compile:

```
sailscoring series list --json > series-dump.json   # against the IODAI workspace
python3 compile.py series-dump.json                  # writes manifest.json
```

`compile.py` joins the dump's series *names* to out-slugs (the built files carry
both) to fill the slug→id map, and emits the `manifest.json` the app consumes. It
errors loudly if any referenced series has no live id rather than emit a partial
map. Then apply it out-of-band — the `.sailscoring` format stays identity-free
and portable:

```
pnpm reconcile-identities <workspace> --manifest manifest.json            # dry run: validate + preview
pnpm reconcile-identities <workspace> --manifest manifest.json --apply    # write identities + links
```
